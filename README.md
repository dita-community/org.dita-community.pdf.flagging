PDF Revision and Status Flagging Extensions
===========================================

This plugin implements revision marking at the topic level such that when topic
elements have @rev and that revision is configured to have a revision
bar (via DITAVAL), the entire topic will get a revision bar and the
topic's entry in the ToC will also get a revision bar.

This plugin works with the out-of-the-box 2.x version of the Open Toolkit.

To use it with the 1.8.5 Open Toolkit you must apply the patch provided
in the dita-ot-1.8.5-patch directory in this project (requires replacing
three files in the PDF2 plugin).
