PDF Revision and Status Flagging Extensions
===========================================

Version 1.1

This version is tested with OT 2.5.4 (last release for 2.x). 

This plugin implements revision marking at the topic level such that when topic elements have @rev and that revision is configured to have a revision bar (via DITAVAL), the entire topic will get a revision bar and the topic's entry in the ToC will also get a revision bar.
